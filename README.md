## Overview

This is the official implementation of **"GotenNet: Rethinking Efficient 3D Equivariant Graph Neural Networks"** published at ICLR 2025.

GotenNet introduces a novel framework for modeling 3D molecular structures that achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach balances expressiveness and efficiency through innovative tensor-based representations and attention mechanisms.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üîÑ **Effective Geometric Tensor Representations**: Leverages geometric tensors without relying on irreducible representations or Clebsch-Gordan transforms
- üß© **Unified Structural Embedding**: Introduces geometry-aware tensor attention for improved molecular representation
- üìä **Hierarchical Tensor Refinement**: Implements a flexible and efficient representation scheme
- üèÜ **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves superior results on QM9, rMD17, MD22, and Molecule3D datasets

## üöÄ Installation

### üîß From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarpaykent/gotennet.git
cd gotennet
```

#### Using pip with conda

```bash
conda create -n gotennet python=3.10
conda activate gotennet
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

#### Using uv

```bash
uv venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip install -e .
```

## üî¨ Usage

### Training a Model

After installation, you can use the `train_gotennet` command:

```bash
train_gotennet
```

Or you can run the training script directly:

```bash
python gotennet/scripts/train.py
```

Both methods use Hydra for configuration. You can reproduce U0 target prediction on the QM9 dataset with the following command:

```bash
train_gotennet experiment=qm9_u0.yaml
```

### Configuration

The project uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for configuration management. Configuration files are located in the `configs/` directory.

Main configuration categories:
- `datamodule`: Dataset configurations (md17, qm9, etc.)
- `model`: Model configurations
- `trainer`: Training parameters
- `callbacks`: Callback configurations
- `logger`: Logging configurations
